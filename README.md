## Custom Themes
TriCord supports custom themes. You can create your own theme by following the **[Theme Format Specification](THEME_FORMAT.md)**.
Check out the [TriCord-Themes](https://github.com/2b-zipper/TriCord-Themes) repository for sample themes.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release (CIA or 3DSX)
2. Install via FBI (CIA) or place in `/3ds/` (3DSX)
3. Launch and log in with QR code or email/password

### Login Methods

**QR Code** — Scan using the Discord mobile app.

**Email / Password** — Enter your credentials directly on the bottom screen.

**token.txt** — If you cannot use the above methods, you can log in using your Discord token:
1. Create a file named `token.txt` at `sdmc:/3ds/TriCord/token.txt`
2. Paste your Discord token inside (plain text, no extra whitespace)
3. Launch TriCord — it will automatically read the token, log in, and delete the file

> ⚠️ Never share your Discord token with anyone. Treat it like a password.

### ⚠️ Security Notice
The account information is stored in `/3ds/TriCord/accounts`. **Although this file is encrypted, never share it with others.** Sharing this file may allow unauthorized access to your Discord account.

## FAQ

### Is there a possibility of an account ban/suspension?
Because WebSockets are properly implemented, the risk is relatively lower compared to previous Discord clients for the 3DS. However, since it is an unofficial client, I cannot guarantee that the risk is zero. You should assume that there is always a risk of getting banned. As stated in the disclaimer, I take no responsibility for any account bans or suspensions.

### The app crashes while loading guilds
This is caused by your account being in too many servers. Please use a different account with fewer guilds. I plan to improve this as much as possible in the future.

### The app is laggy / crashes frequently
This is due to the 3DS hardware limitations, so there is nothing I can do about it. Especially on the Old 3DS, the RAM is half that of the New 3DS and the CPU is much weaker, making it prone to running slowly. I recommend using a New 3DS for the most comfortable experience. While I might add features exclusive to the New 3DS in the future, rest assured that I will never drop support for the Old 3DS.

### I have a question
Feel free to ask in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/quYy9fK8tJ).

### Is there a Voice Chat (VC) feature?
No, it is currently not available and there are no plans for implementation. However, support for text channels within VC channels is planned for the future.

### I cannot log in with the error "Failed to exchange ticket" or "Login failed: Login failed: 0"
This appears to be due to SSL verification failing for some reason. In v0.4.0 or later, you can open Settings, press **Y**, and search for `devmode` to temporarily reveal "Developer Options" at the bottom of the list. By toggling **SSL Verification** to **OFF**, you can skip SSL checks and attempt to connect.
>**WARNING:** Disabling SSL verification lowers security and makes you vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. If you have any security concerns, do not use this option. I do not accept bug reports or provide support for settings within the Developer Options.

### I found a bug
Please report it by opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/2b-zipper/TriCord/issues) or by visiting the bug-reports channel in our Discord server.
