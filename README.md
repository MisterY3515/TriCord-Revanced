This repository is a maintained fork of TriCord (made by 2b-zipper) focused on trying to add some features like the VC (just for the love of the game, I'm not even sure that is possible)

Never share your Discord token or the local account storage files.

## Controls

- **Navigation**: D-Pad to move, `A` to select, `B` to go back, `Y` to enter Voice Channels
- **Message screen**: D-Pad to scroll, `X` for menu actions, `Y` for text input

## Voice Chat

Voice chat is fully integrated and functional!
- Join is available from voice channels (Press `Y`).
- Quick mute toggle using the `X` button.
- Floating voice overlay allows you to manage the call even when browsing other servers.
- *Note: It is still experimental and might experience occasional stutters on older 3DS models.*

If the app crashes while joining voice, collect the files in `sdmc:/3ds/TriCord/`:
- `session.log`
- `session-prev.log`
- `crash_report.txt`
- `tricord.log`

## FAQ

### Is there a possibility of an account ban/suspension?
Because WebSockets are properly implemented, the risk is relatively lower compared to previous Discord clients for the 3DS. However, since it is an unofficial client, I cannot guarantee that the risk is zero. You should assume that there is always a risk of getting banned. As stated in the disclaimer, I take no responsibility for any account bans or suspensions.

### I cannot log in with the error "Failed to exchange ticket" or "Login failed: Login failed: 0"
This appears to be due to SSL verification failing for some reason. In v0.4.0 or later, you can open Settings, press **Y**, and search for `devmode` to temporarily reveal "Developer Options" at the bottom of the list. By toggling **SSL Verification** to **OFF**, you can skip SSL checks and attempt to connect.
>**WARNING:** Disabling SSL verification lowers security and makes you vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. If you have any security concerns, do not use this option. I do not accept bug reports or provide support for settings within the Developer Options.

### I want to add or improve a translation
Please help us translate TriCord into your language on our [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/tricord). If your language is not listed, you can request it directly by clicking the "Request New Language" button on the Crowdin page.

## Known Issues

- Large accounts and large guilds can still stress RAM on old hardware
- Voice chat is experimental and may still crash or disconnect unexpectedly
- Discord API changes can break features without warning
